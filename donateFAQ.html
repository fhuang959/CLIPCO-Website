            <h2>Questions About Donating</h2>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">Why should I donate?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">CLIP depends completely on donations to fund the programs not covered by normal school
                district funds. These programs include the Mandarin Chinese curriculum, CLIP Art program, and Homework
                Club to name a few. Last year, we raised a total of $321,560 ($258,996 from your generous donations, 
                $62,564 in corporate matches.) Without sufficient donations, CLIP cannot provide these additional
                programs to its students. </p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">What does the donation support?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Mandarin instructional materials, Mandarin library books, Mandarin homework club,
                Teacher’s Aides, technology, CLIP Art, student Mandarin assessment tests, and Mandarin curriculum
                development. Details can be found on the CLIPCO annual budget&nbsp;<a
                        href="budget.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">What happens if CLIPCO does not get enough donations? </strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">CLIP depends on CLIPCO to raise the funds needed to keep the program running. In the
                event that CLIPCO is unable to raise the target donation amount, services such as Teacher’s Aides, CLIP
                Art and homework club will have to be cut from the budget. In rare instances, CLIPCO may run a second
                fundraiser campaign. </p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">How much should I donate? </strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Each year the CLIPCO Board of Directors assesses the amount needed to support the
                program and determines the suggested donation amount. For the school year 2017-2018, the suggested
                donation is $450 per student for CLIP Kindergarten to 6th grade students and $225 for CLIP 7th grade to
                8th grade students. </p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">How much do the other Mandarin Immersion schools cost? </strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">CLIP is the only public Mandarin immersion school program available in the Cupertino
                Union School District. However, there are private Mandarin immersion school programs in the region.
                Below are the 2014-2015 tuition fees for two of these private schools. The fees do not include
                additional fees such as enrollment, registration, and material fees.
                <br>
                International School of the Peninsula (Palo Alto) $24,500+
                <br>
                Yew Chung International School (Mountain View)$18,800+ </p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">What are the methods of donation?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Donations can be made by check or credit/debit card.
                <br>
                For check payments, please fill out the pledge form and deposit it along with the check (payable to
                ‘CLIPCO’) at the Meyerholz Elementary school office, to your teacher, or your CLIPCO Representative.
                <br>
                Credit card, debit card, or PayPal payment can be made online at our <a
                        href="http://www.cusdclipco.org/donate.html">donate page</a>.</p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">When should I donate?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">To reduce the crunch during the Direct Give Campaign, we are encouraging people to
                donate early! Bring your donation to the CLIP table at Meyerholz Back to School Night (August 23rd) to
                qualify to receive a CLIP window cling for each student whose family donates the minimum ask in their
                name. For Miller students, turn in your form and check to your child’s CLIP teacher by Friday Aug 25,
                2017 to qualify for the CLIP window cling.</p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">Why am I been asked to donate at the beginning of the school year?</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Services provided to CLIP students are billed to CLIPCO by the school district. During
                October, CLIPCO is billed a large sum, equal to roughly half of its budget, to cover personnel expenses
                such as teacher’s aides. Then in February, CLIPCO is asked to approve the budget for the following
                school year, which it can only do if it has sufficient funds to support the budget. For these reasons,
                donation drive takes place early in the school year to ensure that the program is not disrupted due to
                financial circumstances. </p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">Why is CLIPCO asking for donations when it appears to have enough funds in
                its bank account? </strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">In order to ensure that the CLIP program is not disrupted mid-year due to financial
                circumstances, CLIPCO must have the entire school year’s funds available at the start of each school
                year. As CLIPCO spends its funds to pay off program expenses throughout the current school year, it
                simultaneously raises the funds for the following school year. For this reason, the cash balance does
                not appear to change significantly throughout the school year even though large sums of transactions
                are taking place. The following graph demonstrates the typical cash flow that takes place during the
                school year:</p>
                <br>

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>The graph demonstrates that for the 2012-2013 school year, CLIPCO started with $338,000 and spent
                roughly $300,000 on program expenses, leaving it with just $40,000. However, it raised $290,000 during
                the same period which kept its cash balance at a stable number throughout the year.</p>

            <p><strong class="faq-question" id="corporate-matching">How do I get corporate matching for my donation?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">CLIPCO is a non-partisan and non-profit 501(3)(c) organization. Many companies provide
                their employees the benefit of corporate matching for their favorite non-profit organizations. Since
                each company does it differently, please contact your company’s HR or Benefits department to inquire
                about how your donation may be maximized through a corporate matching program.

            <p><strong class="faq-question">Is my donation tax-deductible?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Donations to CLIPCO, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, is 100% tax-deductible. We
                will be sending out the tax receipt to each donor by January 31, 2018.</p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">Can I donate on behalf of another family?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">As long as the family has agreed to accept a donation on their behalf, CLIPCO is happy
                to accept the generous donation. If you are interested in sponsorship, whether on the giving or the
                receiving end, please contact one of your CLIPCO Representatives.</p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">We are unable to make a donation this year. What can we do to help
                out?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">We understand that not every family has the ability to donate the suggested donation
                amount. We ask that each family donate an amount that is within their ability. There are also other ways
                to help that will make a difference, such as organizing small fundraisers to help raise money for CLIP,
                or do volunteer work that helps CLIPCO keep its expenses down. Please speak to your class representative
                or anyone on the CLIPCO board to learn about your options.

            <h2>Questions about the Direct Give Competition</h2>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">When is the contest taking place? </strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">The Contest kicked off on October 17, and it will end at midnight on November 15th,
                2016. </p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">Why do we need a contest to drive donations?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">The Direct Give Contest is an annual event that encourages friendly competition to
                raise funds for CLIP. This is the fifth year that the contest has taken place. Since it started in
                2010-2011, the participation rate has jumped from roughly 50% in the previous years to nearly 100%! The
                high participation rate allows us to keep the suggested donation amount low since the more families
                donate, the less each family needs to donate in order to keep the program afloat. The high participation
                rate is also a strong indication of the community’s commitment and support of the program.</p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">What are the prizes this year?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Continuing the tradition of the contests in the last three years, this year there are
                three prizes to be had. They are:
                <br>
                Individual Prize: A CLIP Pencil Case and 2 Pencils – awarded to those donating at least $225 per
                student.
                <br>
                Class Prize: Super cool T-shirt with Our Year of the Rooster Logo – awarded to the home room (Meyerholz)
                or grade (Miller) that meets 90% participation rate and 90% target dollar amount.
                <br>
                Grand Prize: A Sling Backpack with Our Year of the Rooster Logo -- awarded to the top 3 home room
                (Meyerholz) or grade (Miller) with the highest percentage towards the target dollar amount.

            </p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">When will the winners receive the prizes? </strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Individual prizes will be handed out to students and parents on specific dates (to be
                announced) during lunch time at the GLC. For any given week, the donation must be received by Sunday in
                order to guarantee that the student's name is on the donated list.
                <br>
                For the Class and Grand prizes, the winning classes will receive their prizes in December before the end
                of 2016.
                <br>
                For CLIP Middle school students, the prizes will be distributed by the CLIPCO representatives to their
                respective classes. </p>
            <p><strong class="faq-question">What is the “CLIPCO Supporter’s Honor Roll”? </strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">CLIP depends completely on donations to fund the curriculum programs not covered by
                normal school district funds. For this reason, we are grateful for the financial support of our
                community and would like to recognize our donors. Donors are recognized on our website throughout the
                school year and on the December CLIPCO Newsletter after the Direct Give Contest. The donation amounts
                that qualify for the tiers below are per student.</p>
